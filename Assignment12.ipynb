    "# Each process function as an independent worker, with its own memory space and python interpreter,enabling true parallelism\n",
    "# This is in contrast to multithreading, which uses multiple threads within a single process, sharing memory and being subject to the global interpreter lock (GIL)\n",
    "# Advantages \n",
    "#1. Harnessing multiple CPU cores\n",
    "#2. Bypassing the GIL Global Interpreter Lock in python limits the multithreading performance by allowing only one thread to execute python bytecode at a time.\n"
